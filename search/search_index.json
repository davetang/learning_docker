An analogy of Docker containers are shipping containers, which provide a standard and consistent way of shipping just about anything. The container includes everything that is needed for an application to run including the code, system tools, and the necessary dependencies. If you wanted to test an application, all you need to do is to download the Docker image and run it in a new container. No more compiling and installing missing dependencies! The overview at https://docs.docker.com/ provides more information. For more a more hands-on approach, check out know Enough Docker to be Dangerous and this short workshop that I prepared for BioC Asia 2019. This README was generated by GitHub Actions using the R Markdown file readme.Rmd , which was executed via the create_readme.sh script. Installing the Docker Engine To get started, you will need to install the Docker Engine; check out this guide . Checking your installation To see if everything is working, try to obtain the Docker version. docker --version ## Docker version 24.0.7, build afdd53b And run the hello-world image. (The --rm parameter is used to automatically remove the container when it exits.) docker run --rm hello-world ## Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally ## latest: Pulling from library/hello-world ## c1ec31eb5944: Pulling fs layer ## c1ec31eb5944: Verifying Checksum ## c1ec31eb5944: Download complete ## c1ec31eb5944: Pull complete ## Digest: sha256:ac69084025c660510933cca701f615283cdbb3aa0963188770b54c31c8962493 ## Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest ## ## Hello from Docker! ## This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly. ## ## To generate this message, Docker took the following steps: ## 1.

One of the main reasons I use Docker is for building tools. For this purpose, I use Docker like a virtual machine, where I can install whatever I want. This is important because I can do my testing in an isolated environment and not worry about affecting the main server. I like to use Ubuntu because it\u2019s a popular Linux distribution and therefore whenever I run into a problem, chances are higher that someone else has had the same problem, asked a question on a forum, and received a solution. Before we can run Ubuntu using Docker, we need an image. We can obtain an Ubuntu image from the official Ubuntu image repository from Docker Hub by running docker pull . docker pull ubuntu:18.04 ## 18.04: Pulling from library/ubuntu ## 7c457f213c76: Pulling fs layer ## 7c457f213c76: Verifying Checksum ## 7c457f213c76: Download complete ## 7c457f213c76: Pull complete ## Digest: sha256:152dc042452c496007f07ca9127571cb9c29697f42acbfad72324b2bb2e43c98 ## Status: Downloaded newer image for ubuntu:18.04 ## docker.io/library/ubuntu:18.04 To run Ubuntu using Docker, we use docker run . docker run --rm ubuntu:18.04 cat /etc/os-release ## NAME=\"Ubuntu\" ## VERSION=\"18.04.6 LTS (Bionic Beaver)\" ## ID=ubuntu ## ID_LIKE=debian ## PRETTY_NAME=\"Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS\" ## VERSION_ID=\"18.04\" ## HOME_URL=\"https://www.ubuntu.com/\" ## SUPPORT_URL=\"https://help.ubuntu.com/\" ## BUG_REPORT_URL=\"https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/\" ## PRIVACY_POLICY_URL=\"https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/terms-and-policies/privacy-policy\" ## VERSION_CODENAME=bionic ## UBUNTU_CODENAME=bionic You can work interactively with the Ubuntu image by specifying the -it option. docker run --rm -it ubuntu:18:04 /bin/bash You may have noticed that I keep using the --rm option, which removes the container once you quit. If you don\u2019t use this option, the container is saved up until the point that you exit; all changes you made, files you created, etc. are saved. Why am I deleting all my changes? Because there is a better (and more reproducible) way to make changes to the system and that is by using a Dockerfile. Start containers automatically When hosting a service using Docker (such as running RStudio Server ), it would be nice if the container automatically starts up again when the server (and Docker) restarts. If you use --restart flag with docker run , Docker will restart your container when your container has exited or when Docker restarts. The value of the --restart flag can be the following: no - do not automatically restart (default) on-failure[:max-retries] - restarts if it exits due to an error (non-zero exit code) and the number of attempts is limited using the max-retries option always - always restarts the container; if it is manually stopped, it is restarted only when the Docker daemon restarts (or when the container is manually restarted) unless-stopped - similar to always but when the container is stopped, it is not restarted even after the Docker daemon restarts. docker run -d \\ --restart always \\ -p 8888:8787 \\ -e PASSWORD=password \\ -e USERID=$(id -u) \\ -e GROUPID=$(id -g) \\ rocker/rstudio:4.1.2 Dockerfile A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building Docker images. A Dockerfile adheres to a specific format and set of instructions, which you can find at Dockerfile reference . There is also a Best practices guide for writing Dockerfiles. A Docker image is made up of different layers and they act like snapshots. Each layer, or intermediate image, is created each time an instruction in the Dockerfile is executed. Each layer is assigned a unique hash and are cached by default. This means that you do not need to rebuild a layer again from scratch if it has not changed. Keep this in mind when creating a Dockerfile. Some commonly used instructions include: FROM - Specifies the parent or base image to use for building an image and must be the first command in the file. COPY - Copies files from the current directory (of where the Dockerfile is) to the image filesystem. RUN - Executes a command inside the image. ADD - Adds new files or directories from a source or URL to the image filesystem. ENTRYPOINT - Makes the container run like an executable. CMD - The default command or parameter/s for the container and can be used with ENTRYPOINT . WORKDIR - Sets the working directory for the image. Any CMD , RUN , COPY , or ENTRYPOINT instruction after the WORKDIR declaration will be executed in the context of the working directory. I have an example Dockerfile that uses the Ubuntu 18.04 image to build BWA , a popular short read alignment tool used in bioinformatics. cat Dockerfile ## FROM ubuntu:18.04 ## ## MAINTAINER Dave Tang <me@davetang.org> ## ## LABEL source=\"https://github.com/davetang/learning_docker/blob/main/Dockerfile\" ## ## RUN apt-get clean all && \\ ## apt-get update && \\ ## apt-get upgrade -y && \\ ## apt-get install -y \\ ## build-essential \\ ## wget \\ ## zlib1g-dev && \\ ## apt-get clean all && \\ ## apt-get purge && \\ ## rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/* /var/tmp/* ## ## RUN mkdir /src && \\ ## cd /src && \\ ## wget https://github.com/lh3/bwa/releases/download/v0.7.17/bwa-0.7.17.tar.bz2 && \\ ## tar xjf bwa-0.7.17.tar.bz2 && \\ ## cd bwa-0.7.17 && \\ ## make && \\ ## mv bwa /usr/local/bin && \\ ## cd && rm -rf /src ## ## WORKDIR /work ## ## CMD [\"bwa\"] ARG To define variables in your Dockerfile use ARG name=value . For example, you can use ARG to create a new variable that stores a version number of a program. When a new version of the program is released, you can simply change the ARG and re-build your Dockerfile. ARG star_ver=2.7.10a RUN cd /usr/src && \\ wget https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/archive/refs/tags/${star_ver}.tar.gz && \\ tar xzf ${star_ver}.tar.gz && \\ rm ${star_ver}.tar.gz && \\ cd STAR-${star_ver}/source && \\ make STAR && \\ cd /usr/local/bin && \\ ln -s /usr/src/STAR-${star_ver}/source/STAR . CMD The CMD instruction in a Dockerfile does not execute anything at build time but specifies the intended command for the image; there can only be one CMD instruction in a Dockerfile and if you list more than one CMD then only the last CMD will take effect. The main purpose of a CMD is to provide defaults for an executing container. COPY The COPY instruction copies new files or directories from <src> and adds them to the filesystem of the container at the path <dest> . It has two forms: COPY [--chown=<user>:<group>] [--chmod=<perms>] <src>... <dest> COPY [--chown=<user>:<group>] [--chmod=<perms>] [\"<src>\",... \"<dest>\"] Note the --chown parameter, which can be used to set the ownership of the copied files/directories. If this is not specified, the default ownership is root , which can be a problem. For example in the RStudio Server Dockerfile , there are two COPY instructions that set the ownership to the rstudio user. COPY --chown=rstudio:rstudio rstudio/rstudio-prefs.json /home/rstudio/.config/rstudio COPY --chown=rstudio:rstudio rstudio/.Rprofile /home/rstudio/ The two files that are copied are config files and therefore need to be writable by rstudio if settings are changed in RStudio Server. Usually the root path of <src> is set to the directory where the Dockerfile exists. The example above is different because the RStudio Server image is built by GitHub Actions, and the root path of <src> is the GitHub repository. ENTRYPOINT An ENTRYPOINT allows you to configure a container that will run as an executable. ENTRYPOINT has two forms: ENTRYPOINT [\u201cexecutable\u201d, \u201cparam1\u201d, \u201cparam2\u201d] (exec form, preferred) ENTRYPOINT command param1 param2 (shell form) FROM ubuntu ENTRYPOINT [\"top\", \"-b\"] CMD [\"-c\"] Use --entrypoint to override ENTRYPOINT instruction. docker run --entrypoint Building an image Use the build subcommand to build Docker images and use the -f parameter if your Dockerfile is named as something else otherwise Docker will look for a file named Dockerfile . The period at the end, tells Docker to look in the current directory. cat build.sh ## #!/usr/bin/env bash ## ## set -euo pipefail ## ## ver=0.7.17 ## ## docker build -t davetang/bwa:${ver} . You can push the built image to Docker Hub if you have an account. I have used my Docker Hub account name to name my Docker image. # use -f to specify the Dockerfile to use # the period indicates that the Dockerfile is in the current directory docker build -f Dockerfile.base -t davetang/base . # log into Docker Hub docker login # push to Docker Hub docker push davetang/base Renaming an image The docker image tag command will create a new tag, i.e. new image name, that refers to an old image. It is not quite renaming but can be considered renaming since you will have a new name for your image. The usage is: Usage: docker image tag SOURCE_IMAGE[:TAG] TARGET_IMAGE[:TAG] For example I have created a new tag for my RStudio Server image, so that I can easily push it to Quay.io. docker image tag davetang/rstudio:4.2.2 quay.io/davetang31/rstudio:4.2.2 The original image davetang/rstudio:4.2.2 still exists, which is why tagging is not quite renaming.

Resource usage To restrict CPU usage use --cpus=n and use --memory= to restrict the maximum amount of memory the container can use. We can confirm the limited CPU usage by running an endless while loop and using docker stats to confirm the CPU usage. Remember to use docker stop to stop the container after confirming the usage! Restrict to 1 CPU. # run in detached mode docker run --rm -d --cpus=1 davetang/bwa:0.7.17 perl -le 'while(1){ }' # check stats and use control+c to exit docker stats CONTAINER ID NAME CPU % MEM USAGE / LIMIT MEM % NET I/O BLOCK I/O PIDS 8cc20bcfa4f4 vigorous_khorana 100.59% 572KiB / 1.941GiB 0.03% 736B / 0B 0B / 0B 1 docker stop 8cc20bcfa4f4 Restrict to 1/2 CPU. # run in detached mode docker run --rm -d --cpus=0.5 davetang/bwa:0.7.17 perl -le 'while(1){ }' # check stats and use control+c to exit docker stats CONTAINER ID NAME CPU % MEM USAGE / LIMIT MEM % NET I/O BLOCK I/O PIDS af6e812a94da unruffled_liskov 50.49% 584KiB / 1.941GiB 0.03% 736B / 0B 0B / 0B 1 docker stop af6e812a94da Copying files between host and container Use docker cp but I recommend mounting a volume to a Docker container (see next section). docker cp --help Usage: docker cp [OPTIONS] CONTAINER:SRC_PATH DEST_PATH|- docker cp [OPTIONS] SRC_PATH|- CONTAINER:DEST_PATH Copy files/folders between a container and the local filesystem Options: -L, --follow-link Always follow symbol link in SRC_PATH --help Print usage # find container name docker ps -a # create file to transfer echo hi > hi.txt docker cp hi.txt fee424ef6bf0:/root/ # start container docker start -ai fee424ef6bf0 # inside container cat /root/hi.txt hi # create file inside container echo bye > /root/bye.txt exit # transfer file from container to host docker cp fee424ef6bf0:/root/bye.txt . cat bye.txt bye Sharing between host and container Use the -v flag to mount directories to a container so that you can share files between the host and container. In the example below, I am mounting data from the current directory (using the Unix command pwd ) to /work in the container. I am working from the root directory of this GitHub repository, which contains the data directory. ls data ## README.md ## chrI.fa.gz Any output written to /work inside the container, will be accessible inside data on the host. The command below will create BWA index files for data/chrI.fa.gz . docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/data:/work davetang/bwa:0.7.17 bwa index chrI.fa.gz ## [bwa_index] Pack FASTA... 0.15 sec ## [bwa_index] Construct BWT for the packed sequence... ## [bwa_index] 2.99 seconds elapse. ## [bwa_index] Update BWT... 0.06 sec ## [bwa_index] Pack forward-only FASTA... 0.11 sec ## [bwa_index] Construct SA from BWT and Occ... 0.91 sec ## [main] Version: 0.7.17-r1188 ## [main] CMD: bwa index chrI.fa.gz ## [main] Real time: 4.258 sec; CPU: 4.242 sec We can see the newly created index files. ls -lrt data ## total 30436 ## -rw-r--r-- 1 runner docker 194 Jan 5 04:28 README.md ## -rw-r--r-- 1 runner docker 4772981 Jan 5 04:28 chrI.fa.gz ## -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 15072516 Jan 5 04:34 chrI.fa.gz.bwt ## -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 3768110 Jan 5 04:34 chrI.fa.gz.pac ## -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 41 Jan 5 04:34 chrI.fa.gz.ann ## -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 13 Jan 5 04:34 chrI.fa.gz.amb ## -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7536272 Jan 5 04:34 chrI.fa.gz.sa However note that the generated files are owned by root , which is slightly annoying because unless we have root access, we need to start a Docker container with the volume re-mounted to alter/delete the files. File permissions As seen above, files generated inside the container on a mounted volume are owned by root . This is because the default user inside a Docker container is root . In Linux, there is typically a root user with the UID and GID of 0; this user exists in the host Linux environment (where the Docker engine is running) as well as inside the Docker container. In the example below, the mounted volume is owned by UID 1211 and GID 1211 (in the host environment). This UID and GID does not exist in the Docker container, thus the UID and GID are shown instead of a name like root . This is important to understand because to circumvent this file permission issue, we need to create a user that matches the UID and GID in the host environment. ls -lrt # total 2816 # -rw-r--r-- 1 1211 1211 1000015 Apr 27 02:00 ref.fa # -rw-r--r-- 1 1211 1211 21478 Apr 27 02:00 l100_n100_d400_31_2.fq # -rw-r--r-- 1 1211 1211 21478 Apr 27 02:00 l100_n100_d400_31_1.fq # -rw-r--r-- 1 1211 1211 119 Apr 27 02:01 run.sh # -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1000072 Apr 27 02:03 ref.fa.bwt # -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 250002 Apr 27 02:03 ref.fa.pac # -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 40 Apr 27 02:03 ref.fa.ann # -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 12 Apr 27 02:03 ref.fa.amb # -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 500056 Apr 27 02:03 ref.fa.sa # -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 56824 Apr 27 02:04 aln.sam As mentioned already, having root ownership is problematic because when we are back in the host environment, we can\u2019t modify these files.

When you log out of a container, the changes made are still stored; type docker ps -a to see all containers and the latest changes. Use docker commit to commit your changes. docker ps -a # git style commit # -a, --author= Author (e.g., \"John Hannibal Smith <hannibal@a-team.com>\") # -m, --message= Commit message docker commit -m 'Made change to blah' -a 'Dave Tang' <CONTAINER ID> <image> # use docker history <image> to check history docker history <image> Access running container To access a container that is already running, perhaps in the background (using detached mode: docker run with -d ) use docker ps to find the name of the container and then use docker exec . In the example below, my container name is rstudio_dtang . docker exec -it rstudio_dtang /bin/bash Cleaning up exited containers I typically use the --rm flag with docker run so that containers are automatically removed after I exit them. However, if you don\u2019t use --rm , by default a container\u2019s file system persists even after the container exits. For example: docker run hello-world ## ## Hello from Docker! ## This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly. ## ## To generate this message, Docker took the following steps: ## 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon. ## 2. The Docker daemon pulled the \"hello-world\" image from the Docker Hub. ## (amd64) ## 3.

Yes! We offer unlimited storage and serving of public repositories. We strongly believe in the open source community and will do what we can to help! Use docker login to login and use the credentials you set up when you created an account on Quay.io. docker login quay.io Quay.io images are prefixed with quay.io , so I used docker image tag to create a new tag of my RStudio Server image.

This allows images to be automatically built and pushed to Docker Hub. There is also support for Quay.io . Tips Tip from https://support.pawsey.org.au/documentation/display/US/Containers : each RUN, COPY, and ADD command in a Dockerfile generates another layer in the container thus increasing its size; use multi-line commands and clean up package manager caches to minimise image size: RUN apt-get update \\ && apt-get install -y \\ autoconf \\ automake \\ gcc \\ g++ \\ python \\ python-dev \\ && apt-get clean all \\ && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* I have found it handy to mount my current directory to the same path inside a Docker container and to set it as the working directory ; the directory will be automatically created inside the container if it does not already exist. When the container starts up, I will conveniently be in my current directory. In the command below I have also added the -u option, which sets the user to <name|uid>[:<group|gid>] . docker run --rm -it -u $(stat -c \"%u:%g\" ${HOME}) -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -w $(pwd) davetang/build:1.1 /bin/bash If you do not want to preface docker with sudo , create a Unix group called docker and add users to it. On some Linux distributions, the system automatically creates this group when installing Docker Engine using a package manager. In that case, there is no need for you to manually create the group. Check /etc/group to see if the docker group exists. cat /etc/group | grep docker If the docker group does not exist, create the group: sudo groupadd docker Add users to the group. sudo usermod -aG docker $USER The user will need to log out and log back in, before the changes take effect. On Linux, Docker is installed in /var/lib/docker . docker info -f '{{ .DockerRootDir }}' # /var/lib/docker This may not be ideal depending on your partitioning. To change the default root directory update the daemon configuration file; the default location on Linux is /etc/docker/daemon.json . The example below makes /home/docker the Docker root directory. cat /etc/docker/daemon.json # { # \"data-root\": \"/home/docker\" # } Restart the Docker server and check the Docker root directory. sudo systemctl restart docker docker info -f '{{ .DockerRootDir}}' # /home/docker Useful links Post installation steps A quick introduction to Docker The BioDocker project ; check out their Wiki , which has a lot of useful information The impact of Docker containers on the performance of genomic pipelines Learn enough Docker to be useful 10 things to avoid in Docker containers The Play with Docker classroom brings you labs and tutorials that help you get hands-on experience using Docker Shifter enables container images for HPC http://biocworkshops2019.bioconductor.org.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/page/BioconductorOnContainers__Bioconductor_Containers_Workshop/","title":"Learning Docker"},{"location":"#learning-docker","text":"","title":"Learning Docker"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"Docker is an open source project that allows one to pack, ship, and run any application as a lightweight container.

A Dockerfile adheres to a specific format and set of instructions, which you can find at Dockerfile reference . There is also a Best practices guide for writing Dockerfiles. A Docker image is made up of different layers and they act like snapshots. Each layer, or intermediate image, is created each time an instruction in the Dockerfile is executed. Each layer is assigned a unique hash and are cached by default. This means that you do not need to rebuild a layer again from scratch if it has not changed. Keep this in mind when creating a Dockerfile. Some commonly used instructions include: FROM - Specifies the parent or base image to use for building an image and must be the first command in the file. COPY - Copies files from the current directory (of where the Dockerfile is) to the image filesystem. RUN - Executes a command inside the image. ADD - Adds new files or directories from a source or URL to the image filesystem. ENTRYPOINT - Makes the container run like an executable. CMD - The default command or parameter/s for the container and can be used with ENTRYPOINT . WORKDIR - Sets the working directory for the image. Any CMD , RUN , COPY , or ENTRYPOINT instruction after the WORKDIR declaration will be executed in the context of the working directory. I have an example Dockerfile that uses the Ubuntu 18.04 image to build BWA , a popular short read alignment tool used in bioinformatics. cat Dockerfile ## FROM ubuntu:18.04 ## ## MAINTAINER Dave Tang <me@davetang.org> ## ## LABEL source=\"https://github.com/davetang/learning_docker/blob/main/Dockerfile\" ## ## RUN apt-get clean all && \\ ## apt-get update && \\ ## apt-get upgrade -y && \\ ## apt-get install -y \\ ## build-essential \\ ## wget \\ ## zlib1g-dev && \\ ## apt-get clean all && \\ ## apt-get purge && \\ ## rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/* /var/tmp/* ## ## RUN mkdir /src && \\ ## cd /src && \\ ## wget https://github.com/lh3/bwa/releases/download/v0.7.17/bwa-0.7.17.tar.bz2 && \\ ## tar xjf bwa-0.7.17.tar.bz2 && \\ ## cd bwa-0.7.17 && \\ ## make && \\ ## mv bwa /usr/local/bin && \\ ## cd && rm -rf /src ## ## WORKDIR /work ## ## CMD [\"bwa\"]","title":"Dockerfile"},{"location":"#arg","text":"To define variables in your Dockerfile use ARG name=value .

If this is not specified, the default ownership is root , which can be a problem. For example in the RStudio Server Dockerfile , there are two COPY instructions that set the ownership to the rstudio user. COPY --chown=rstudio:rstudio rstudio/rstudio-prefs.json /home/rstudio/.config/rstudio COPY --chown=rstudio:rstudio rstudio/.Rprofile /home/rstudio/ The two files that are copied are config files and therefore need to be writable by rstudio if settings are changed in RStudio Server.

When the container starts up, I will conveniently be in my current directory. In the command below I have also added the -u option, which sets the user to <name|uid>[:<group|gid>] . docker run --rm -it -u $(stat -c \"%u:%g\" ${HOME}) -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -w $(pwd) davetang/build:1.1 /bin/bash If you do not want to preface docker with sudo , create a Unix group called docker and add users to it. On some Linux distributions, the system automatically creates this group when installing Docker Engine using a package manager. In that case, there is no need for you to manually create the group. Check /etc/group to see if the docker group exists. cat /etc/group | grep docker If the docker group does not exist, create the group: sudo groupadd docker Add users to the group. sudo usermod -aG docker $USER The user will need to log out and log back in, before the changes take effect. On Linux, Docker is installed in /var/lib/docker . docker info -f '{{ .DockerRootDir }}' # /var/lib/docker This may not be ideal depending on your partitioning. To change the default root directory update the daemon configuration file; the default location on Linux is /etc/docker/daemon.json . The example below makes /home/docker the Docker root directory. cat /etc/docker/daemon.json # { # \"data-root\": \"/home/docker\" # } Restart the Docker server and check the Docker root directory. sudo systemctl restart docker docker info -f '{{ .DockerRootDir}}' # /home/docker","title":"Tips"},{"location":"#useful-links","text":"Post installation steps A quick introduction to Docker The BioDocker project ; check out their Wiki , which has a lot of useful information The impact of Docker containers on the performance of genomic pipelines Learn enough Docker to be useful 10 things to avoid in Docker containers The Play with Docker classroom brings you labs and tutorials that help you get hands-on experience using Docker Shifter enables container images for HPC http://biocworkshops2019.bioconductor.org.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/page/BioconductorOnContainers__Bioconductor_Containers_Workshop/","title":"Useful links"}]}
