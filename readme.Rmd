## Introduction

![](https://github.com/davetang/learning_docker/actions/workflows/create_readme.yml/badge.svg)

Docker is an open source project that allows one to pack, ship, and run any
application as a lightweight container. An analogy of Docker containers are
shipping containers, which provide a standard and consistent way of shipping
just about anything. The container includes everything that is needed for an
application to run including the code, system tools, and the necessary
dependencies. If you wanted to test an application, all you need to do is to
download the Docker image and run it in a new container. No more compiling and
installing missing dependencies!

The [overview](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) at
https://docs.docker.com/ provides more information. For more a more hands-on
approach, check out know [Enough Docker to be
Dangerous](https://docs.docker.com/) and [this short
workshop](https://davetang.github.io/reproducible_bioinformatics/docker.html)
that I prepared for BioC Asia 2019.

This README was generated by GitHub Actions using the R Markdown file
`readme.Rmd`, which was executed via the `create_readme.sh` script.

## Installing the Docker Engine

To get started, you will need to install the Docker Engine; check out [this
guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

## Checking your installation

To see if everything is working, try to obtain the Docker version.

```{bash engine.opts='-l'}
docker --version
```

And run the `hello-world` image. (The `--rm` parameter is used to automatically
remove the container when it exits.)

```{bash engine.opts='-l'}
docker run --rm hello-world
```

## Docker information

Get more version information.

```{bash engine.opts='-l'}
docker version
```

Even more information.

```{bash engine.opts='-l'}
docker info
```

## Basics

The two guides linked in the introduction section provide some information on
the basic commands but I'll include some here as well. One of the main reasons
I use Docker is for building tools. For this purpose, I use Docker like a
virtual machine, where I can install whatever I want. This is important because
I can do my testing in an isolated environment and not worry about affecting
the main server. I like to use Ubuntu because it's a popular Linux distribution
and therefore whenever I run into a problem, chances are higher that someone
else has had the same problem, asked a question on a forum, and received a
solution.

Before we can run Ubuntu using Docker, we need an image. We can obtain an
Ubuntu image from the [official Ubuntu image
repository](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu/) from Docker Hub by running
`docker pull`.

```{bash engine.opts='-l'}
docker pull ubuntu:18.04
```

To run Ubuntu using Docker, we use `docker run`.

```{bash engine.opts='-l'}
docker run --rm ubuntu:18.04 cat /etc/os-release
```

You can work interactively with the Ubuntu image by specifying the `-it`
option.

```console
docker run --rm -it ubuntu:18:04 /bin/bash
```

You may have noticed that I keep using the `--rm` option, which removes the
container once you quit. If you don't use this option, the container is saved
up until the point that you exit; all changes you made, files you created, etc.
are saved. Why am I deleting all my changes? Because there is a better (and
more reproducible) way to make changes to the system and that is by using a
Dockerfile.

## Start containers automatically

When hosting a service using Docker (such as running [RStudio
Server](https://davetang.org/muse/2021/04/24/running-rstudio-server-with-docker/https://davetang.org/muse/2021/04/24/running-rstudio-server-with-docker/)),
it would be nice if the container automatically starts up again when the server
(and Docker) restarts. If you use `--restart flag` with `docker run`, Docker
will [restart your
container](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/start-containers-automatically/)
when your container has exited or when Docker restarts. The value of the
`--restart` flag can be the following:

* `no` - do not automatically restart (default)
* `on-failure[:max-retries]` - restarts if it exits due to an error (non-zero
  exit code) and the number of attempts is limited using the `max-retries`
  option
* `always` - always restarts the container; if it is manually stopped, it is
  restarted only when the Docker daemon restarts (or when the container is
  manually restarted)
* `unless-stopped` - similar to `always` but when the container is stopped, it
  is not restarted even after the Docker daemon restarts.

```console
docker run -d \
   --restart always \
   -p 8888:8787 \
   -e PASSWORD=password \
   -e USERID=$(id -u) \
   -e GROUPID=$(id -g) \
   rocker/rstudio:4.1.2
```

## Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building Docker
images. A Dockerfile adheres to a specific format and set of instructions,
which you can find at [Dockerfile
reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/). There is also a
[Best practices
guide](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/)
for writing Dockerfiles.

A Docker image is made up of different layers and they act like snapshots. Each
layer, or intermediate image, is created each time an instruction in the
Dockerfile is executed. Each layer is assigned a unique hash and are cached by
default. This means that you do not need to rebuild a layer again from scratch
if it has not changed. Keep this in mind when creating a Dockerfile.

Some commonly used instructions include:

* `FROM` - Specifies the parent or base image to use for building an image and
  must be the first command in the file.
* `COPY` - Copies files from the current directory (of where the Dockerfile is)
  to the image filesystem.
* `RUN` - Executes a command inside the image.
* `ADD` - Adds new files or directories from a source or URL to the image
  filesystem.
* `ENTRYPOINT` - Makes the container run like an executable.
* `CMD` - The default command or parameter/s for the container and can be used
  with `ENTRYPOINT`.
* `WORKDIR` - Sets the working directory for the image. Any `CMD`, `RUN`,
  `COPY`, or `ENTRYPOINT` instruction after the `WORKDIR` declaration will be
  executed in the context of the working directory.

I have an example Dockerfile that uses the Ubuntu 18.04 image to build
[BWA](https://github.com/lh3/bwa), a popular short read alignment tool used in
bioinformatics.

```{bash engine.opts='-l'}
cat Dockerfile
```

### ARG

To define variables in your Dockerfile use `ARG name=value`. For example, you
can use `ARG` to create a new variable that stores a version number of a
program. When a new version of the program is released, you can simply change
the `ARG` and re-build your Dockerfile.

```
ARG star_ver=2.7.10a
RUN cd /usr/src && \
    wget https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/archive/refs/tags/${star_ver}.tar.gz && \
    tar xzf ${star_ver}.tar.gz && \
    rm ${star_ver}.tar.gz && \
    cd STAR-${star_ver}/source && \
    make STAR && \
    cd /usr/local/bin && \
    ln -s /usr/src/STAR-${star_ver}/source/STAR .
```

### CMD

The [CMD](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd) instruction in
a Dockerfile does not execute anything at build time but specifies the intended
command for the image; there can only be one CMD instruction in a Dockerfile
and if you list more than one CMD then only the last CMD will take effect. The
main purpose of a CMD is to provide defaults for an executing container.

### COPY

The [COPY](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy) instruction
copies new files or directories from `<src>` and adds them to the filesystem of
the container at the path `<dest>`. It has two forms:

```
COPY [--chown=<user>:<group>] [--chmod=<perms>] <src>... <dest>
COPY [--chown=<user>:<group>] [--chmod=<perms>] ["<src>",... "<dest>"]
```

Note the `--chown` parameter, which can be used to set the ownership of the
copied files/directories. If this is not specified, the default ownership is
`root`, which can be a problem.

For example in the RStudio Server
[Dockerfile](https://github.com/davetang/learning_docker/blob/main/rstudio/Dockerfile),
there are two `COPY` instructions that set the ownership to the `rstudio` user.

```
COPY --chown=rstudio:rstudio rstudio/rstudio-prefs.json /home/rstudio/.config/rstudio
COPY --chown=rstudio:rstudio rstudio/.Rprofile /home/rstudio/
```

The two files that are copied are config files and therefore need to be
writable by `rstudio` if settings are changed in RStudio Server.

Usually the root path of `<src>` is set to the directory where the Dockerfile
exists. The example above is different because the RStudio Server image is
built by GitHub Actions, and the root path of `<src>` is the GitHub repository.

### ENTRYPOINT

An [ENTRYPOINT](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint)
allows you to configure a container that will run as an executable. ENTRYPOINT
has two forms:

* ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2"] (exec form, preferred)
* ENTRYPOINT command param1 param2 (shell form)

```console
FROM ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT ["top", "-b"]
CMD ["-c"]
```

Use `--entrypoint` to override ENTRYPOINT instruction.

```console
docker run --entrypoint
```

## Building an image

Use the `build` subcommand to build Docker images and use the `-f` parameter if
your Dockerfile is named as something else otherwise Docker will look for a
file named `Dockerfile`. The period at the end, tells Docker to look in the
current directory.

```{bash engine.opts='-l'}
cat build.sh
```

You can push the built image to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) if you
have an account. I have used my Docker Hub account name to name my Docker
image.

```console
# use -f to specify the Dockerfile to use
# the period indicates that the Dockerfile is in the current directory
docker build -f Dockerfile.base -t davetang/base .

# log into Docker Hub
docker login

# push to Docker Hub
docker push davetang/base
```

## Renaming an image

The `docker image tag` command will create a new tag, i.e. new image name, that
refers to an old image. It is not quite renaming but can be considered renaming
since you will have a new name for your image.

The usage is:

    Usage:  docker image tag SOURCE_IMAGE[:TAG] TARGET_IMAGE[:TAG]

For example I have created a new tag for my RStudio Server image, so that I can
easily push it to Quay.io.

```console
docker image tag davetang/rstudio:4.2.2 quay.io/davetang31/rstudio:4.2.2
```

The original image `davetang/rstudio:4.2.2` still exists, which is why tagging
is not quite renaming.

## Running an image

[Docker run documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/).

```{bash engine.opts='-l'}
docker run --rm davetang/bwa:0.7.17
```

## Resource usage

To [restrict](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/)
CPU usage use `--cpus=n` and use `--memory=` to restrict the maximum amount of
memory the container can use.

We can confirm the limited CPU usage by running an endless while loop and using
`docker stats` to confirm the CPU usage. *Remember to use `docker stop` to stop
the container after confirming the usage!*

Restrict to 1 CPU.

```console
# run in detached mode
docker run --rm -d --cpus=1 davetang/bwa:0.7.17 perl -le 'while(1){ }'

# check stats and use control+c to exit
docker stats
CONTAINER ID   NAME             CPU %     MEM USAGE / LIMIT   MEM %     NET I/O     BLOCK I/O   PIDS
8cc20bcfa4f4   vigorous_khorana   100.59%   572KiB / 1.941GiB   0.03%     736B / 0B   0B / 0B     1

docker stop 8cc20bcfa4f4
```

Restrict to 1/2 CPU.

```console
# run in detached mode
docker run --rm -d --cpus=0.5 davetang/bwa:0.7.17 perl -le 'while(1){ }'

# check stats and use control+c to exit
docker stats

CONTAINER ID   NAME             CPU %     MEM USAGE / LIMIT   MEM %     NET I/O     BLOCK I/O   PIDS
af6e812a94da   unruffled_liskov   50.49%    584KiB / 1.941GiB   0.03%     736B / 0B   0B / 0B     1

docker stop af6e812a94da
```

## Copying files between host and container

Use `docker cp` but I recommend mounting a volume to a Docker container (see
next section).

```console
docker cp --help

Usage:  docker cp [OPTIONS] CONTAINER:SRC_PATH DEST_PATH|-
        docker cp [OPTIONS] SRC_PATH|- CONTAINER:DEST_PATH

Copy files/folders between a container and the local filesystem

Options:
  -L, --follow-link   Always follow symbol link in SRC_PATH
      --help          Print usage

# find container name
docker ps -a

# create file to transfer
echo hi > hi.txt

docker cp hi.txt fee424ef6bf0:/root/

# start container
docker start -ai fee424ef6bf0

# inside container
cat /root/hi.txt 
hi

# create file inside container
echo bye > /root/bye.txt
exit

# transfer file from container to host
docker cp fee424ef6bf0:/root/bye.txt .

cat bye.txt 
bye
```

## Sharing between host and container

Use the `-v` flag to mount directories to a container so that you can share
files between the host and container.

In the example below, I am mounting `data` from the current directory (using
the Unix command `pwd`) to `/work` in the container. I am working from the root
directory of this GitHub repository, which contains the `data` directory.

```{bash engine.opts='-l'}
ls data
```

Any output written to `/work` inside the container, will be accessible inside
`data` on the host. The command below will create BWA index files for
`data/chrI.fa.gz`.

```{bash engine.opts='-l'}
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/data:/work davetang/bwa:0.7.17 bwa index chrI.fa.gz
```

We can see the newly created index files.

```{bash engine.opts='-l'}
ls -lrt data
```

However note that the generated files are owned by `root`, which is slightly
annoying because unless we have root access, we need to start a Docker
container with the volume re-mounted to alter/delete the files.

### File permissions

As seen above, files generated inside the container on a mounted volume are
owned by `root`. This is because the default user inside a Docker container is
`root`. In Linux, there is typically a `root` user with the UID and GID of 0;
this user exists in the host Linux environment (where the Docker engine is
running) as well as inside the Docker container.

In the example below, the mounted volume is owned by UID 1211 and GID 1211 (in
the host environment). This UID and GID does not exist in the Docker container,
thus the UID and GID are shown instead of a name like `root`. This is important
to understand because to circumvent this file permission issue, we need to
create a user that matches the UID and GID in the host environment.

```console
ls -lrt
# total 2816
# -rw-r--r-- 1 1211 1211 1000015 Apr 27 02:00 ref.fa
# -rw-r--r-- 1 1211 1211   21478 Apr 27 02:00 l100_n100_d400_31_2.fq
# -rw-r--r-- 1 1211 1211   21478 Apr 27 02:00 l100_n100_d400_31_1.fq
# -rw-r--r-- 1 1211 1211     119 Apr 27 02:01 run.sh
# -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1000072 Apr 27 02:03 ref.fa.bwt
# -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  250002 Apr 27 02:03 ref.fa.pac
# -rw-r--r-- 1 root root      40 Apr 27 02:03 ref.fa.ann
# -rw-r--r-- 1 root root      12 Apr 27 02:03 ref.fa.amb
# -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  500056 Apr 27 02:03 ref.fa.sa
# -rw-r--r-- 1 root root   56824 Apr 27 02:04 aln.sam
```

As mentioned already, having `root` ownership is problematic because when we
are back in the host environment, we can't modify these files. To circumvent
this, we can create a user that matches the host user by passing three
environmental variables from the host to the container.

```console
docker run -it \
  -v ~/my_data:/data \
  -e MYUID=$(id -u) \
  -e MYGID=$(id -g) \
  -e ME=$(whoami) \
  bwa /bin/bash
```

We use the environment variables and the following steps to create an identical
user inside the container.

```console
adduser --quiet --home /home/san/$ME --no-create-home --gecos "" --shell /bin/bash --disabled-password $ME

# optional: give yourself admin privileges
echo "%$ME ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" >> /etc/sudoers

# update the IDs to those passed into Docker via environment variable
sed -i -e "s/1000:1000/$MYUID:$MYGID/g" /etc/passwd
sed -i -e "s/$ME:x:1000/$ME:x:$MYGID/" /etc/group

# su - as the user
exec su - $ME

# run BWA again, after you have deleted the old files as root
bwa index ref.fa
bwa mem ref.fa l100_n100_d400_31_1.fq l100_n100_d400_31_2.fq > aln.sam

# check output
ls -lrt
# total 2816
# -rw-r--r-- 1 dtang dtang 1000015 Apr 27 02:00 ref.fa
# -rw-r--r-- 1 dtang dtang   21478 Apr 27 02:00 l100_n100_d400_31_2.fq
# -rw-r--r-- 1 dtang dtang   21478 Apr 27 02:00 l100_n100_d400_31_1.fq
# -rw-r--r-- 1 dtang dtang     119 Apr 27 02:01 run.sh
# -rw-rw-r-- 1 dtang dtang 1000072 Apr 27 02:12 ref.fa.bwt
# -rw-rw-r-- 1 dtang dtang  250002 Apr 27 02:12 ref.fa.pac
# -rw-rw-r-- 1 dtang dtang      40 Apr 27 02:12 ref.fa.ann
# -rw-rw-r-- 1 dtang dtang      12 Apr 27 02:12 ref.fa.amb
# -rw-rw-r-- 1 dtang dtang  500056 Apr 27 02:12 ref.fa.sa
# -rw-rw-r-- 1 dtang dtang   56824 Apr 27 02:12 aln.sam

# exit container
exit
```

This time when you check the file permissions in the host environment, they
should match your username.

```console
ls -lrt ~/my_data
# total 2816
# -rw-r--r-- 1 dtang dtang 1000015 Apr 27 10:00 ref.fa
# -rw-r--r-- 1 dtang dtang   21478 Apr 27 10:00 l100_n100_d400_31_2.fq
# -rw-r--r-- 1 dtang dtang   21478 Apr 27 10:00 l100_n100_d400_31_1.fq
# -rw-r--r-- 1 dtang dtang     119 Apr 27 10:01 run.sh
# -rw-rw-r-- 1 dtang dtang 1000072 Apr 27 10:12 ref.fa.bwt
# -rw-rw-r-- 1 dtang dtang  250002 Apr 27 10:12 ref.fa.pac
# -rw-rw-r-- 1 dtang dtang      40 Apr 27 10:12 ref.fa.ann
# -rw-rw-r-- 1 dtang dtang      12 Apr 27 10:12 ref.fa.amb
# -rw-rw-r-- 1 dtang dtang  500056 Apr 27 10:12 ref.fa.sa
# -rw-rw-r-- 1 dtang dtang   56824 Apr 27 10:12 aln.sam
```

### File Permissions 2

There is a `-u` or `--user` parameter that can be used with `docker run` to run
a container using a specific user. This is easier than creating a new user.

In this example we run the `touch` command as `root`.

```{bash engine.opts='-l'}
docker run -v $(pwd):/$(pwd) ubuntu:22.10 touch $(pwd)/test_root.txt
ls -lrt $(pwd)/test_root.txt
```

In this example, we run the command as a user with the same UID and GID; the
`stat` command is used to get the UID and GID.

```{bash engine.opts='-l'}
docker run -v $(pwd):/$(pwd) -u $(stat -c "%u:%g" $HOME) ubuntu:22.10 touch $(pwd)/test_mine.txt
ls -lrt $(pwd)/test_mine.txt
```

One issue with this method is that you may encounter the following warning (if
running interactively):

```
groups: cannot find name for group ID 1000
I have no name!@ed9e8b6b7622:/$
```

This is because the user in your host environment does not exist in the
container environment. As far as I am aware, this is not a problem; we just
want to create files/directories with matching user and group IDs.

### Read only

To mount a volume but with read-only permissions, append `:ro` at the end.

```{bash engine.opts='-l'}
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/work:ro davetang/bwa:0.7.17 touch test.txt
```

## Removing the image

Use `docker rmi` to remove an image. You will need to remove any stopped
containers first before you can remove an image. Use `docker ps -a` to find
stopped containers and `docker rm` to remove these containers.

Let's pull the `busybox` image.

```{bash engine.opts='-l'}
docker pull busybox
```

Check out `busybox`.

```{bash engine.opts='-l'}
docker images busybox
```

Remove `busybox`.

```{bash engine.opts='-l'}
docker rmi busybox
```

## Committing changes

Generally, it is better to use a Dockerfile to manage your images in a
documented and maintainable way but if you still want to [commit
changes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/commit/) to your
container (like you would for Git), read on.

When you log out of a container, the changes made are still stored; type
`docker ps -a` to see all containers and the latest changes. Use `docker
commit` to commit your changes.

```console
docker ps -a

# git style commit
# -a, --author=       Author (e.g., "John Hannibal Smith <hannibal@a-team.com>")
# -m, --message=      Commit message
docker commit -m 'Made change to blah' -a 'Dave Tang' <CONTAINER ID> <image>

# use docker history <image> to check history
docker history <image>
```

## Access running container

To access a container that is already running, perhaps in the background (using
detached mode: `docker run` with `-d`) use `docker ps` to find the name of the
container and then use `docker exec`.

In the example below, my container name is `rstudio_dtang`.

```console
docker exec -it rstudio_dtang /bin/bash
```

## Cleaning up exited containers

I typically use the `--rm` flag with `docker run` so that containers are
automatically removed after I exit them. However, if you don't use `--rm`, by
default a container's file system persists even after the container exits. For
example:

```{bash engine.opts='-l'}
docker run hello-world
```

Show all containers.

```{bash engine.opts='-l'}
docker ps -a
```

We can use a sub-shell to get all (`-a`) container IDs (`-q`) that have exited
(`-f status=exited`) and then remove them (`docker rm -v`).

```{bash engine.opts='-l'}
docker rm -v $(docker ps -a -q -f status=exited)
```

Check to see if the container still exists.

```{bash engine.opts='-l'}
docker ps -a
```

We can set this up as a Bash script so that we can easily remove exited
containers. In the Bash script `-z` returns true if `$exited` is empty, i.e. no
exited containers, so we will only run the command when `$exited` is not true.

```{bash engine.opts='-l'}
cat clean_up_docker.sh
```

As I have mentioned, you can use the
[--rm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#clean-up---rm) parameter
to automatically clean up the container and remove the file system when the
container exits.

```{bash engine.opts='-l'}
docker run --rm hello-world
```

No containers.

```{bash engine.opts='-l'}
docker ps -a
```

## Installing Perl modules

Use `cpanminus`.

```console
apt-get install -y cpanminus

# install some Perl modules
cpanm Archive::Extract Archive::Zip DBD::mysql
```

## Creating a data container

This [guide on working with Docker data
volumes](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-work-with-docker-data-volumes-on-ubuntu-14-04)
provides a really nice introduction. Use `docker create` to create a data
container; the `-v` indicates the directory for the data container; the `--name
data_container` indicates the name of the data container; and `ubuntu` is the
image to be used for the container.

```console
docker create -v /tmp --name data_container ubuntu
```

If we run a new Ubuntu container with the `--volumes-from` flag, output written
to the `/tmp` directory will be saved to the `/tmp` directory of the
`data_container` container.

```console
docker run -it --volumes-from data_container ubuntu /bin/bash
```

## R

Use images from [The Rocker Project](https://www.rocker-project.org/), for
example `rocker/r-ver:4.3.0`.

```{bash engine.opts='-l'}
docker run --rm rocker/r-ver:4.3.0
```

## Saving and transferring a Docker image

You should just share the Dockerfile used to create your image but if you need
another way to save and share an image, see [this
post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23935141/how-to-copy-docker-images-from-one-host-to-another-without-via-repository)
on Stack Overflow.

```console
docker save -o <save image to path> <image name>
docker load -i <path to image tar file>
```

Here's an example.

```console

## Sharing your image

### Docker Hub

Create an account on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/); my account is
`davetang`. Use `docker login` to login and use `docker push` to push to Docker
Hub (run `docker tag` first if you didn't name your image in the format of
`yourhubusername/newrepo`).

```console
docker login

# create repo on Docker Hub then tag your image
docker tag bb38976d03cf yourhubusername/newrepo

# push
docker push yourhubusername/newrepo
```

### Quay.io

Create an account on [Quay.io](https://quay.io/); you can use Quay.io for free as
stated in their [plans](https://quay.io/plans/):

> Can I use Quay for free?
> Yes! We offer unlimited storage and serving of public repositories. We
> strongly believe in the open source community and will do what we can to
> help!

Use `docker login` to [login](https://docs.quay.io/guides/login.html) and use
the credentials you set up when you created an account on Quay.io.

```console
docker login quay.io
```

Quay.io images are prefixed with `quay.io`, so I used `docker image tag` to create
a new tag of my RStudio Server image. (Unfortunately, the username `davetang`
was taken on RedHat [possibly by me a long time ago], so I have to use
`davetang31` on Quay.io.)

```console
docker image tag davetang/rstudio:4.2.2 quay.io/davetang31/rstudio:4.2.2
```

Push to Quay.io.

```console
docker push quay.io/davetang31/rstudio:4.2.2
```

### GitHub Actions

[login-action](https://github.com/docker/login-action) is used to automatically
login to [Docker Hub](https://github.com/docker/login-action#docker-hub) when
using GitHub Actions. This allows images to be automatically built and pushed
to Docker Hub. There is also support for
[Quay.io](https://github.com/docker/login-action#quayio).

## Tips

Tip from https://support.pawsey.org.au/documentation/display/US/Containers:
each RUN, COPY, and ADD command in a Dockerfile generates another layer in the
container thus increasing its size; use multi-line commands and clean up
package manager caches to minimise image size:

```console
RUN apt-get update \
      && apt-get install -y \
         autoconf \
         automake \
         gcc \
         g++ \
         python \
         python-dev \
      && apt-get clean all \
      && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

I have found it handy to mount my current directory to the same path inside a
Docker container and to [set it as the working
directory](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#set-working-directory--w);
the directory will be automatically created inside the container if it does not
already exist. When the container starts up, I will conveniently be in my
current directory. In the command below I have also added the `-u` option,
which sets the user to `<name|uid>[:<group|gid>]`.

```console
docker run --rm -it -u $(stat -c "%u:%g" ${HOME}) -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -w $(pwd) davetang/build:1.1 /bin/bash
```

If you do not want to preface `docker` with `sudo`, create a Unix group called
`docker` and add users to it. On some Linux distributions, the system
automatically creates this group when installing Docker Engine using a package
manager. In that case, there is no need for you to manually create the group.
Check `/etc/group` to see if the `docker` group exists.

```console
cat /etc/group | grep docker
```

If the `docker` group does not exist, create the group:

```console
sudo groupadd docker
```

Add users to the group.

```console
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

The user will need to log out and log back in, before the changes take effect.

On Linux, Docker is installed in `/var/lib/docker`.

```console
docker info -f '{{ .DockerRootDir }}'
# /var/lib/docker
```

This may not be ideal depending on your partitioning. To change the default
root directory update the daemon configuration file; the default location on
Linux is `/etc/docker/daemon.json`. This file may not exist, so you need to
create it.

The example below makes `/home/docker` the Docker root directory; you can use
any directory you want but just make sure it exists.

```console
cat /etc/docker/daemon.json
```
```
{
   "data-root": "/home/docker"
}
```

Restart the Docker server (this will take a little time, since all the files
will be copied to the new location) and then check the Docker root directory.

```console
sudo systemctl restart docker
docker info -f '{{ .DockerRootDir}}'
```
```
/home/docker
```

Check out the new home!

```console
sudo ls -1 /home/docker
```
```
buildkit
containers
engine-id
image
network
overlay2
plugins
runtimes
swarm
tmp
volumes
```
